TECHNICAL INNOVATIONS & RESEARCH PROJECTS¨ MCMH Regressor + Classification for ETA Prediction (Fourkites, 2023-2024): Developed a novel hybrid approach combining Monte Carlo Markov Chain methods with hierarchical regression and classification techniques to improve ETA prediction accuracy. This method adaptively handles multimodal transportation factors and dynamically adjusts predictions based on real-time conditions.  ¨ Backlink Attribution & SEO Ranking Algorithm (Adobe, 2021-2022): Created a statistical model and algorithm to quantify the precise relationship between backlink acquisition strategies and SEO ranking improvements. The model incorporated over 50 backlink quality factors and established predictive curves for determining optimal backlink investment to achieve target ranking positions.  ¨ Real-Time Ad Selection System Architecture (Paytm, 2022-2023): Designed a multi-level scoring and normalization framework for millisecond-level ad selection decisions, integrating ML prediction scores with business constraints and contextual relevance signals.
